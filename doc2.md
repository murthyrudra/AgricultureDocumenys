A spell of stormy weather is expected to sweep across India this week, with the IMD forecasting rain, thunderstorms, hailstorms, and even dust storms in several regions. Additionally, some parts of the country are preparing for an early heatwave. From the northern hills to the southern coastal plains, India is set to experience a variety of weather conditions in the coming days.

Widespread Rain and Thunderstorms Across North and East India
A Western Disturbance and multiple upper air cyclonic circulations are influencing weather over the northern plains and northeastern states. Due to these systems, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is expected in Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and parts of East and Northeast India.
